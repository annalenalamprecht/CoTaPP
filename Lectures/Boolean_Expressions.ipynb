This allows us to let our program behave differently in different situations. Furthermore we will take a short detour and take a look at binary numbers.\n",

    "Note that Python performs a \"lazy evaluation\" of Boolean expressions, that is, it will process the expression from left to right, but only until the point where a certain decision can be made if it evaluates to ```True``` or ```False```. For example, when we enter “Tuesday” in the program above, the evaluation will stop after the check for Friday, at it is clear at this point that the and expression cannot become ```True``` any more. If we enter “Wednesday”, it will skip the test for Friday, but it still it needs to confirm both of the times to be sure that it is lecture time (and can stop after one of them fails). Taking into account this lazy evaluation behavior can help to write more efficient evaluations, for example by checking those things first that can already determine the result of the complete expression, or by performing \"expensive\" calls (e.g. to external databases) only when it is really needed for determining the outcome. In the program above it might be somewhat faster to check the times first and then the day, but for human readers it is more logical to check the day first."
