    "Packages are used to organize sets of modules hierarchically. Technically, they are folders that contains modules and a special ```__init__.py``` file (to indicate that the modules in this folder form a package). We donâ€™t go into further detail here, but note that when using modules from collections of functionality such as the Python Standard Library, they are distributed as packages.\n",

    "The Python Standard Library, which is distributed with the Python installation, contains random and a large number of other useful packages, such as the ```calendar```,  ```statistics``` or ```io``` libraries. We will see and use some of them in the following lectures. The website https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html lists what is contained in the standard library of Python and is a good reference during development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the packages in the standard library, there are also many packages available from other sources. The Python Package index at https://pypi.python.org/\n",
    "pypi is the central repository for Python packages, currently ca. 130,000 of them. With the Anaconda platform a large number of packages has already been installed on your system, but sometimes packages are not yet installed on your machine, so you have to do that yourself before you can use them. How to do this within Anaconda is described at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#installing-a-package. Alternatively, the basic way to do install new packages is via the command line, using the ```pip``` tool that comes with the Python installation: ```pip install <module>```\n",
