    "Last time we talked about the implementation of repetitive behavior (loops).

    "Today’s lecture will discuss functions, modules and packages, have a quick look at the Python’s standard library and the Python Package Index, and introduce the principle of recursion and recursive function definitions. When Python programs become complex, it is a good idea to structure the code using functions, modules, and packages. Proper modularization will keep the code base easier to understand and maintain, and is in fact one of the principles of good software development. Another important principle is the reuse of already existing functionality (rather than implementing it again), so familiarity with the standard libraries is important.\n",

    "We have seen and used functions before (```print```, ```input```, and ```bin```, for example), now it is time to have a more systematic look at them and to define functions ourselves. Functions are useful whenever a piece of code forms a self-contained component and is (potentially) used repeatedly in the program. It simplifies coding, testing, debugging and maintenance if this code is only defined once (as a function) and just called when it is needed. Here is an example of code with unnecessary repetitions:\n"

    "This example illustrates another feature of functions: variable names are local to the function. That is, argument names and variables declared inside a function are not visible outside of the function. The area in a program where variables are visible is also called their scope. As a general rule, a variable’s scope is the block that it has been declared in, starting from the point where its name was defined. In the example above, this means that the ```n``` in the ```fac``` function is another ```n``` than the one in the program below the function. The function does not change the value of the n in the calling (part of the) program. This behavior makes a lot of sense sense: If you use a function from a library, where you cannot or do not want to look into its implementation, it is good to know that it will not interfere with your own variables. Generally, data should only be passed to and retrieved from functions through their parameters and return values, respectively, as this is the safest way to avoid undesired side effects from e.g. variables that overwrite each other unintentionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the ```global``` statement can be used to make variables known across scopes.

The use of the ```global``` statement is however strongly discouraged for the reasons given above, so we will not discuss it further.\n",

For example, a function ```add(a,b)``` for adding to numbers. When calling the function, the arguments have to passed in the order of the parameters.\n",

    "Furthermore, functions can have named parameters. They are identified by their name, so their order does not matter when calling the function. They are also given a default value when they are declared, so that when the calling function does not specify them, there is a standard value to work with.
