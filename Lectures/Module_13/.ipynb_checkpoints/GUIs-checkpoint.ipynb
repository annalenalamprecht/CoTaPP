    "There is a large number of frameworks and toolkits available for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python (see e.g. the list at https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming). We will focus here on how to create GUIs with Tkinter (see the official reference at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), which is the fairly easy-to-use standard GUI framework included in Python. The following introduction to Tkinter is largely based on the very elaborate “Thinking Tkinter” tutorial available online at http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/.\n",

This ```root``` object is the the highest-level GUI component in any Tkinter application, often also referred to as the “toplevel window”. Finally, the ```mainloop``` method of the root object is executed. As the name suggests, it starts the main loop of the application window. This loop runs continuously, waiting for events, handling them when they occur, and only stopping when the window is closed.\n",

    "Obviously, what needs to happen from here is to add further components to the root window, and implement the functionality to handle events that occur from interaction of a user with the interface.
