    "There is a large number of frameworks and toolkits available for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python (see e.g. the list at https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming). We will focus here on how to create GUIs with Tkinter (see the official reference at https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), which is the fairly easy-to-use standard GUI framework included in Python. The following introduction to Tkinter is largely based on the very elaborate “Thinking Tkinter” tutorial available online at http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/.\n",

    "First the Tkinter library is imported under the name ```tk``` for easier reference. Then an instance of the class ```Tkinter.Tk``` is created, which creates a basic window object. This ```root``` object is the the highest-level GUI component in any Tkinter application, often also referred to as the “toplevel window”. Finally, the ```mainloop``` method of the root object is executed. As the name suggests, it starts the main loop of the application window. This loop runs continuously, waiting for events, handling them when they occur, and only stopping when the window is closed.\n",

Also, open-sourcing code of computational experiments is in line with reproducibility standards, etc. In other areas, for example commercial software development, the situation is often different. Customers should use the developed software, but not see the code. They should not need a development environment, but just be able to run a stand-alone version of the program (for historical reasons usually called “executable”, although that is not a very intuitive term for interpreted languages like Python, which you can in principle always directly execute).\n",

    "The trick thing with executables (in Python, but also with many other languages) is that they are platform-specific. That is, they can be made for either Windows, Mac OS or Linux platforms, so several versions are needed to make all potential users happy. Furthermore, you can usually only build executables for a specific platform on a machine with the same (kind of) operating system, so professional development teams run different (virtual) machines to be able to do that.\n",

PyInstaller (https://www.pyinstaller.org/) is one of the few of them that supports all major platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac OS and Linux) and most of the recent Python versions, so it is often a good choice, definitely for a course like this one.\n",

    "My laptop runs on Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) so we will see how it works there. Generally the process on Windows and Mac OS platforms is the same, but in detail it might differ a bit. The PyInstaller manual at https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ provides quite elaborate instructions for all platforms (on the process, but also regarding requirements and common errors), so please refer to that when you try to build executables for your Python programs.\n",

    "Note that Python will automatically detect that modules that are imported by the (main) .py file from which the executable is generated also need to be included in the executable. In case further files are to be included, such as README or other files with additional information about the program, or sample input data files, PyInstaller needs to be told about them (e.g. via the command line). And of course there are many more options and advanced features that can be relevant especially when creating executables for larger, more complex programs, but the PyInstaller website and community should be able the help with that, too."

    "In an earlier lecture, we programmed a little command-line number-guessing game. The program would generate a random number between 1 and 10, and then ask the user too guess a number until they hit the right one. When the guess is wrong, it would display a message if it is too large or too small. \n",

    "### 2. QR Code Generator with GUI (★★★★☆)\n",
    "In a previous exercise you implemented a command-line client for a QR code generation web service. (If you did not complete the exercise, you can use the code from the sample solution as a basis.) Now use the Tkinter framework to build a graphical user interface (GUI) for the functionality. The user should be able to enter a text and the RGB codes for foreground and background color. After a click on a button the QR code is generated and displayed. (The image does not have to be saved as a file, and for simplicity you can always create and process the image in the same format, for example png). \n",
