This allows us to let our program behave differently in different situations. Furthermore we took a short detour to look at binary numbers.\n",

Software is tested to validate that it is doing what it is supposed to do, and in particular that it is not doing anything that it is not supposed to do. To do this, it is executed with all sorts of possible inputs, especially those representing unusual or \"corner cases\" that are maybe not so obvious, and that a programmer might easily overlook. In summary we could just say: Testing is about trying to make software fail. Debugging then means to identify the cause of the failure and fix the code so that it does not fail any more. Note that for the development of big and complex software systems, there are also comprehensive testing and debugging frameworks available. For the projects in this course we will not need to use those, but no programming project is free of testing and debugging, so we will discuss some of the most important basics and pragmatics here.\n",

    "### 4. Temperature Conversion Revisited (★★★★☆)\n",
    "Extend the temperature conversion program from last week so that it asks the user to enter both a temperature value and the unit of the temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), and calculates the temperature in the respecive other unit. If an incorrect unit is entered, the program should give an error message and ask the user to try again. Furthermore, after having done a conversion, the program should ask the user if they want to convert another temperature value. The output should be something like: \n",
