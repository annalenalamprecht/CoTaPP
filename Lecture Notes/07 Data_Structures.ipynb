    "## Data Structures in Python \n",
    "We have already seen the four basic data types that Python provides: string, integer, float and Boolean. Data structures are more than data types, they are used to represent more complex types of data. There are four built-in data structures in Python: lists, tuples, dictionaries and sets. They are all special kinds of variables that can store more than just one value. In lists and tuples the elements have a defined order. Lists, dictionaries and sets are the so-called mutable data structures, meaning that it is possible to add, edit or delete elements. Lists and tuples allow for duplicates, while dictionaries (at least for the keys) and sets contain each value at most once. All these data structures are iterable, that is, a for-loop can automatically go through all their elements."

    "When copying lists, whether completely or partially with the slicing operators, it needs to be taken into account that copying of complex objects like lists behaves a bit differently than the copying of simple variable values. If the usual assignment operator (=) is used, only the reference to the list is copied, meaning that all changes to the original list are also visible in the copied list, because they refer to the same object. When using the slicing operator or a dedicated `copy()` function, the (respective) elements of the list are copied into a new object that is independent from the original. This is sometimes also called a \"shallow copy\". If the list contains a reference to another list or complex object, however, only the reference will be copied. Therefore, in this case \"deep copy\" needs to be made in order to copy the whole list completely. The following code illustrates the difference:"

However, the printouts after the function calls show a difference: The string is still the same as before the manipulation, while the dictionary has changed. The reason for this lies in the way that parameters are passed to functions. Passing variables of the basic data types (such as strings, integers, floats and booleans) happens as call-by-value, that is, the current value of the variable is copied to create a new local variable with the same value for use inside the function. Because it is only visible in the scope of the function, however, changes to it will not be visible after the function. To achieve that, the new values would have to be returned by the function and, e.g., assigned to another variable by the calling code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, passing variables of complex data types (such as lists and dictionaries) happens as call-by-reference. As with shallow copies, only the reference to the (address of the) object in the memory is copied to a new variable and passed as argument, but no (deep) copy of the object itself is created. Thus, manipulations to the object that happen inside a function will also be visible afterwards, also without returning and re-assigning the result of the function. If a function is not supposed to be able to change the object passed as an argument, a (deep) copy needs to be made before it is passed to the function."
