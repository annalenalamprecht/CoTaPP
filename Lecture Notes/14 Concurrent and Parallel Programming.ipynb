    "## Background: Von Neumann Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The von Neumann model (also known as von Neumann architecture) is an early description of a design architecture for computers. John von Neumann and others proposed it in 1945, and the principles still hold for today's computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The model describes a computer to consist of input devices (think of keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, camera, ...), output devices (screens, printers, sounds, ...), random-access memory (RAM) for storing data and instructions (including programs), and a central processing unit (CPU) comprising of control unit (for managing instructions), an arithmetic logic unit (for carrying out operations) and registers (CPU-internal memory). The CPU is ultimately reponsible for carrying out all operations needed for running a computer. This includes the operating system with all its processes, the installed software that is being used, as well as own programs that are executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "CPUs are extremely fast. For example, the Intel Core i7 CPU in my laptop is said to have a speed of 4.9 GHz, roughly meaning that it can carry out up to 4.9 * 10<sup>9</sup> instructions per second. Note that this refers to machine-level instructions, which are of finer granularity than the instructions we have in Python. A single line of Python code typically translates into several lines of machine code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original formulation the model assumed a single-CPU system, but as the figure below illustrates, it easily extends to multiple CPUs. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Concurrency vs. Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms *concurrency* and *parallelism* are often used interchangeably, but it is useful to distinguish them carefully, as the difference can have important implications for programming concurrent and parallel behaviour. Note that not all programmers use the same definitions, so you might come across different meanings. We use the definitions as in https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Concurrency* is the ability of different (parts of) programs to be executed in arbitray order and thereby producing the same final outcome. This sounds abstract, but we use concurrent programs all the time. Concurrency makes programs more usable. For example, even if our computer, laptop or phone has only one processor, we usually run several programs at the same time. The browser has several tabs open for the latest news, the e-mail app is regularly checking for new messages, and in between we use different messenger apps for communicating with friends. Thereby it does not matter for the final outcome if we read the news first (or in which order), read our e-mail after we finished that, and only then go to our messenger app, or if we do all these things interleavingly with frequent switching between the programs. The processes are concurrent. Also within a single program there can be concurrency. For example, in the messenger app we have different chats to which we can attend in arbitary order, or we can interrupt writing a message by setting a new status or profile picture, or just do it aftwards, the outcome would be the same. If you think about it a bit, you will discover many more concurrent processes in the software you use on a day-to-day basis. Many of them are visible at the user interface level, but there are also many more \"under the hood\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent (parts of) programs can, but don't have to, be executed in parallel. If there is only one computing resource (processor) available, the concurrent processes will take turns in using it for taking the next steps. If there is more than one available, they can also (in parts) be distributed over the different resources and run at the same time, in parallel. In such multi-processor or multi-core systems, parallel execution can significantly improve the overall speed of exeuction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, *parallelism* in programming refers to techniques to make programs faster by perfoming multiple computations at the same time, exploiting the capabilites of a multi-processor or multi-core system. Typically, but not necessarily, this is used for problems that have can be divided into sub-computations of the same structure. For example, applying the same complex computation to all elements of a list can be done in parallel. Also graphic computations on GPUs are parallelism (and in fact GPUs are also used for massively parallelizing non-graphics computations in various areas, as they can be extremely fast). A key problem in parallelism is to identify sub-computations that have no or minimal data depencies between each other, so that they can be performed independeltly or with minimal communication between them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Python does not support concurrent or parallel programming, but there are various libraries available that make it possible (see, e.g. https://wiki.python.org/moin/ParallelProcessing). We will have a look at two options from the standard library: thread-based parallelism with `threading` and process-based parallelism with `multiprocessing`."

    "### The Coffeehouse \n",
    "The idea here is to mimick what happens in a coffehouse. The processes that happen at each table are actually very similar: guests arrive, study the menu, order drinks and food, receive and consume them, pay and leave. This process is represented by a function that does simple printouts and pauses a few seconds between them (using seconds for what could be minutes in real life). The main program here then starts the process for three tables (it's a small coffeehouse). In addition, it measures the time needed for completing all three processes. This will be useful later to compare the execution time with concurrent and parallel implementations of the coffeehouse."

    "## Concurrent Programming in Python with `threading`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` library makes it possible to start concurrent processes from within a Python program. These processes are then called *threads*. Even if more than one CPU is available, all threads run on one processing unit. Technically, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is responsible for this. GIL is a mechanism in Python that allows the intepreter to run only one instruction at a time. While it has certain advantages (like e.g. a shared memory that simplifies inter-process communication) it does not help much to make programs faster. (We will see examples of that later.)\n",

    "As the variation of the Coffeehouse example below illustrates, we can use `threading` to simply create a set of Threads, launch and join them. As the output shows, the order of activities is more realistic, and the overall process is faster (because threads can `sleep` without requiring attention)."

    "## Parallelization with Process Pools\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous examples, we worked with fixed numbers of threads and processes. However, in practice parallelization is used to apply the same function to many data items at the same time, such as (chunks of) a long list of input variables. For example, instead of only managing a small cafe with three tables, an actual coffee house might have tenths of tables (and the simulation program run the same process for all of them). Similarly, we might want to apply the individual functions of the text analysis program to a whole list of input texts, where parallelization could yield a significant speedup. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest solution that Python offers here is probably the pooling feature of `multiprocessing` (note that something like this is not available in `threading`). It allows for parallelizing the execution of a function across multiple input values, by distributing the input data across parallel processes. \n",

    "So far for a quick introduction to the basic principles of concurrent and parallel programming with Python. There are more things to consider when going for more complex applications and serious multi-core systems (high performance computing clusters, etc.). For example, exchange of objects and synchronization between processes becomes more important, but also more intricate. There are separate courses on concurrent and parallel programming, and also the web offers a lot of information.\n",

    "This is the \"how to prepare pasta with tomato sauce\" Activity Diagram that we used in Module 2 to introduce the concept of parallel execution. Write a Python program that mimicks this process in a simple concurrent setting (assuming availability of only one cooking plate) and in a parallel setting (assuming availability of two cooking plates that can be used at the same time). Define two functions `prepare_pasta` and `prepare_sauce` for the concurrent parts of the overall process.\n",
