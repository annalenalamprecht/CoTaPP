Proper modularization will keep the code base easier to understand and maintain, and is in fact one of the principles of good software development. Another important principle is the reuse of already existing functionality (rather than implementing it again), so familiarity with the standard libraries is important.\n",

    "This example illustrates another feature of functions: variable names are local to the function. That is, argument names and variables declared inside a function are not visible outside of the function. The area in a program where variables are visible is also called their scope. As a general rule, a variable’s scope is the block that it has been declared in, starting from the point where its name was defined. In the example above, this means that the ```n``` in the ```fac``` function is another ```n``` than the one in the program below the function. The function does not change the value of the n in the calling (part of the) program. This behavior makes a lot of sense sense: If you use a function from a library, where you cannot or do not want to look into its implementation, it is good to know that it will not interfere with your own variables. Generally, data should only be passed to and retrieved from functions through their parameters and return values, respectively, as this is the safest way to avoid undesired side effects from e.g. variables that overwrite each other unintentionally.\n",

The Python Package index at https://pypi.python.org/pypi is the central repository for Python packages, currently ca. 290,000 of them. With the Anaconda platform a large number of popular packages has already been installed on your system, but sometimes packages are not yet installed on your machine, so you have to do that yourself before you can use them. How to do this within Anaconda is described at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/manage-packages/#installing-a-package. Alternatively, the basic way to do install new packages is via the command line, using the ```pip``` tool that comes with the Python installation: ```pip install <module>```"
