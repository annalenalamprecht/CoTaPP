Invisible Fish
BY JOY HARJO
Invisible fish swim this ghost ocean now described by waves of sand, by water-worn rock.
Soon the fish will learn to walk.
Then humans will come ashore and paint dreams on the dying stone.
Then later, much later, the ocean floor will be punctuated by Chevy trucks, carrying the dreamersâ€™ decendants, who are going to the store.
